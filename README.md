# Interactive Resume – Jancarlo Rojas

An AI-powered interactive resume website that allows visitors to ask questions about my background, experience, personality, and career goals in real time.

Instead of a static PDF, this project turns my resume into structured data and connects it to an AI chat interface for dynamic responses.

## 🚀 Overview

This project transforms my professional profile into a structured, modular data system that powers an AI-driven chat experience.

Visitors can:
- Ask about my experience
- Explore my technical skills
- Learn about my personality and work style
- Understand my career goals
- View my projects
- Evaluate my consulting fit

The AI pulls from organized JSON files to generate intelligent, context-aware responses.

## 🧠 Architecture

The application is structured into multiple data layers:

### 📁 Data Layer (`/data`)
- `profile.json` – Basic identity & professional summary
- `resume.json` – Education, experience, technical skills
- `personality.json` – Strengths, drivers, development areas, work style
- `projects.json` – Personal projects & learning interests
- `career_goals.json` – Career direction & long-term vision
- `leadership.json` – Leadership style & growth areas
- `performance.json` – Competitive traits & growth profile
- `behavioral.json` – Behavioral examples (interview-style responses)

This modular structure allows the AI to respond intelligently to HR-style, technical, and consulting-focused prompts.
